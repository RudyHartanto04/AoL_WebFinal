# Laravel

The Laravel framework is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in most web projects, such as authentication, routing, sessions, and caching.

## Installation

To get started with your Laravel project, you need to install the required dependencies using Composer. Run the following commands in your terminal:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-laravel-project.git
    ```

2. Navigate to your project folder:
    ```bash
    cd your-laravel-project
    ```

3. Install the dependencies using Composer:
    ```bash
    composer install
    ```

4. Set up your environment file:
    Laravel requires an `.env` file for configuration. You can copy the default environment configuration file by running:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

5. Generate the application key:
    ```bash
    php artisan key:generate
    ```

6. Set up your database configuration:
    Open the `.env` file and set the database connection values to match your environment.

    Example:
    ```env
    DB_CONNECTION=mysql
    DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
    DB_PORT=3306
    DB_DATABASE=your-database-name
    DB_USERNAME=your-database-username
    DB_PASSWORD=your-database-password
    ```

7. Run the migrations:
    ```bash
    php artisan migrate
    ```

8. Serve the application:
    You can now serve the application using the built-in Laravel development server:
    ```bash
    php artisan serve
    ```

    Your application should be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

## Usage

To interact with the application, you can use the following commands:

- Run tests:
    ```bash
    php artisan test
    ```

- Create a new controller:
    ```bash
    php artisan make:controller YourController
    ```

- Create a new model:
    ```bash
    php artisan make:model YourModel
    ```

- Run the artisan commands:
    ```bash
    php artisan
    ```
